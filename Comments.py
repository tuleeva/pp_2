#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

#Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

#A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
