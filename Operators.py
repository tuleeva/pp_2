#In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
print(10 + 5)

#Operator Precedence
#Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

#Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +,
# and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:
print(100 + 5 * 3)

#Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence,
# and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
