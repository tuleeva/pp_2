#Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks,
#or double quotation marks.
#'hello' is the same as "hello".

print("Hello")
print('Hello')

#You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')

#Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
a = "Hello"
print(a)
