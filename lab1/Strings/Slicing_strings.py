#Slicing
#You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
#Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon,
#  to return a part of the string.
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])

#Slice From the Start
#By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])

#Slice To the End
#By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])

#Negative Indexing
#From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)
#To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
