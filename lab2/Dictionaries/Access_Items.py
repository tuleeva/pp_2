#You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, 
# inside square brackets:

  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]

#There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
x = thisdict.get("model")

#Get Keys
#The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.keys()

#Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.keys()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "white"

print(x) #after the change

#Get Values
#The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.values()

#Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "red"

print(x) #after the change

#Get Items
#The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
x = thisdict.items()

#Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
