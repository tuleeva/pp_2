#Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

#Dictionary Items
#Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates.
#Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs,
#  and can be referred to by using the key name.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

#Duplicates Not Allowed
#Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)

#Dictionary Length
#To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:
print(len(thisdict))

#Dictionary Items - Data Types
#The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}

#Print the data type of a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(type(thisdict))

#Using the dict() method to make a dictionary:
thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)
